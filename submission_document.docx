1. Executive Summary
This project examines student enrollment, course costs, and professor evaluation scores to identify opportunities to improve student satisfaction without raising course costs. We used Amazon QuickSight (Q + Topics + Dashboards + Scenarios + Data Story) to: create a dataset, build visuals using Q, configure a Topic with Named Entities and Verified Questions, publish a dashboard, develop a scenario to explore the central business question, and create a final data story with recommendations.

•	Action: Attempted to create dataset using manifest s3://RegionalCommunityCollegeBucket/EnrollmentData/EnrollmentManifest.json.

10. Data Story — Create & Polish
10.1 Use Q to auto-generate an initial Data Story; improve with custom text blocks and visuals
Include visuals in story:
•	Student Majors by Year
•	Proportion of Student Types
•	Average EvaluationScore by Course
•	Average CostPerCourse by Course
[Insert screenshot: (Data Story cover with Prepared by and story pages)]
(If you have separate screenshots for Data Story cover/page1/page2, insert them here.)
Data Story text (example):
Executive summary: This story explores how professor effectiveness (EvaluationScore) relates to course costs and enrollment. We identify best practice professors who earn high evaluation scores at moderate or low cost, and low-cost courses with poor evaluations that would benefit most from targeted interventions.
Recommendations (from story):
1.	Pilot instructor development program for low-cost/low-eval courses.
2.	Document and scale teaching practices from high-eval/low-cost professors.
3.	Use QuickSight weekly refresh to monitor impact.

11. Listings of All Created Resources (for submission)
•	Datasets: Q - Student Enrollment (published)
•	Analyses: Student Enrollment Analysis
•	Dashboards: Student Enrollment Dashboard (initial & replaced)
•	Topics: Regional Community College Student Data
•	Scenarios: Improving Student Satisfaction Without Increasing Costs (initial & recreated)
•	Data Story: From College Boards to Dashboards
[Insert screenshot: (list of resources or AWS QuickSight Home showing resources)]

12. Methodology (brief)
1.	Use QuickSight sample dataset & Q to create visuals quickly.
2.	Prepare dataset: rename fields, create calculated fields, set refresh schedule.
3.	Create Topic, define named entities and verify Q answers.
4.	Build Analysis with Q-powered visuals; refine formatting and titles.
5.	Publish Analysis as Dashboard with Q enabled.
6.	Build Scenarios and iterate with follow-up questions until recommendation emerges.
7.	Generate Data Story, refine narrative, and add Prepared by.
