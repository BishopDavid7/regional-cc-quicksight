1. Executive Summary
This project examines student enrollment, course costs, and professor evaluation scores to identify opportunities to improve student satisfaction without raising course costs. We used Amazon QuickSight (Q + Topics + Dashboards + Scenarios + Data Story) to: create a dataset, build visuals using Q, configure a Topic with Named Entities and Verified Questions, publish a dashboard, develop a scenario to explore the central business question, and create a final data story with recommendations.

2. Dataset Preparation Evidence
2.1 Attempt to create dataset from S3 manifest (expected error)
•	Action: Attempted to create dataset using manifest s3://RegionalCommunityCollegeBucket/EnrollmentData/EnrollmentManifest.json.
•	Result: Error — fictional bucket; dataset creation cancelled.

Caption: AcademicYear formatted to remove commas.
 
Caption: Visual reconfigured to vertical bar chart.






3.2 Visual: Proportion of Student Types (pie)
•	Prompt used: “Pie chart of Student Types.”
•	Actions taken: Renamed to Proportion of Student Types, resized legend and chart.
 Caption: Proportion of Student Types (pie chart).

3.3 (Additional visuals created during extension)
•	Professors with best average evaluations.
•	Courses with best average evaluations.
•	Professors with highest average course costs.

10. Data Story — Create & Polish
10.1 Use Q to auto-generate an initial Data Story; improve with custom text blocks and visuals
Include visuals in story:
•	Student Majors by Year
•	Proportion of Student Types
•	Average EvaluationScore by Course
•	Average CostPerCourse by Course
  
Data Story text:
Our analysis identifies an opportunity for strategic improvement in both student satisfaction and institutional effectiveness through carefully increasing class sizes in certain humanities courses. Drivers of success such as dynamic discussion boards, breakout study groups, and adaptive learning systems ensure academic quality is maintained even while enrollment increases. A well-executed implementation strategy—bolstered by phased expansion, faculty, and milestone-driven evaluation—offers a firm foundation for success. Financially, the projected ROI indicates that raising class sizes can generate operating savings that in turn can be invested in new technology, teaching assistant programs, and other learning tools. This balanced approach allows institutions to enhance educational outcomes while achieving sustainable cost management. Recommendations (from story):
1.	Pilot instructor development program for low-cost/low-eval courses.
2.	Document and scale teaching practices from high-eval/low-cost professors.
3.	Use QuickSight weekly refresh to monitor impact.

11. Listings of All Created Resources (for submission)
•	Datasets: Q - Student Enrollment (published)

•	Data Story: From College Boards to Dashboards

12. Methodology (brief)
1.	Use QuickSight sample dataset & Q to create visuals quickly.
2.	Prepare dataset: rename fields, create calculated fields, set refresh schedule.
3.	Create Topic, define named entities and verify Q answers.
4.	Build Analysis with Q-powered visuals; refine formatting and titles.
5.	Publish Analysis as Dashboard with Q enabled.
6.	Build Scenarios and iterate with follow-up questions until recommendation emerges.
7.	Generate Data Story, refine narrative, and add Prepared by.
