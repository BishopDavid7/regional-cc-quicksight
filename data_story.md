# Data Story — From College Boards to Dashboards

Prepared by: Pascal Esegemou Ekenya Fonjock

Executive summary:
This story explores how professor effectiveness (EvaluationScore) relates to course costs and enrollment. We identify best practice professors who earn high evaluation scores at moderate or low cost, and low-cost courses with poor evaluations that would benefit most from targeted interventions.

Recommendations:
1. Pilot an instructor development program focused on identified low-cost, low-eval courses.
2. Document and scale teaching practices from high-eval/low-cost professors.
3. Use QuickSight with weekly refreshes to monitor impact.
