# Data Story — From College Boards to Dashboards

Prepared by: Your Full Name

Executive summary:
This story explores how professor effectiveness (EvaluationScore) relates to course costs and enrollment. We identify best practice professors who earn high evaluation scores at moderate or low cost, and low-cost courses with poor evaluations that would benefit most from targeted interventions.

Visuals included:
- Student Majors by Year — screenshots/11_student_majors_by_year_vertical_bar.png
- Proportion of Student Types — screenshots/12_proportion_of_student_types_pie.png
- Avg EvaluationScore by Course — screenshots/29_vis_courses_best_eval.png
- Avg CostPerCourse by Course — screenshots/31_vis_courses_highest_cost.png

Recommendations:
1. Pilot an instructor development program focused on identified low-cost, low-eval courses.
2. Document and scale teaching practices from high-eval/low-cost professors.
3. Use QuickSight with weekly refreshes to monitor impact.
