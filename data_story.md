## Executive Summary
This story explores how professor effectiveness (*EvaluationScore*) relates to course costs and enrollment.  
We identify high-performing professors who achieve excellent evaluation scores at moderate or low cost, and highlight low-cost courses with poor evaluations that would benefit most from targeted interventions.

- Document and scale teaching practices from high-evaluation, low-cost professors.  
- Leverage QuickSight with weekly refreshes to monitor ongoing impact.
