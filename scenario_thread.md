## Thread Sequence
1. Which professors have above-average evaluation scores **and** below-average cost per course?  
2. Is there a correlation between **Class Size (CourseEnrollmentCount)** and **EvaluationScore**?  
3. Do **Student Type (Youth vs Adult Continuing Education)** affect EvaluationScore?  
4. Which low-cost courses have **low evaluation scores** and could benefit from interventions?  
5. **Recommendation:** Pilot program to test inexpensive instructional improvements.
