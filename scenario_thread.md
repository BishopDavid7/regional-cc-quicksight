# Scenario: Improving Student Satisfaction Without Increasing Costs

Scenario name: Improving Student Satisfaction Without Increasing Costs
Starter question: How do we improve professor evaluations while avoiding an increase in cost per course?

Selected visuals:
- Student Majors by Year (screenshots/11_student_majors_by_year_vertical_bar.png)
- Proportion of Student Types (screenshots/12_proportion_of_student_types_pie.png)
- Professors — Best Avg Evaluation (screenshots/28_vis_prof_best_eval.png)
- Courses — Best Avg Evaluation (screenshots/29_vis_courses_best_eval.png)
- Professors — Highest Avg Cost (screenshots/30_vis_prof_highest_cost.png)
- Courses — Highest Avg Cost (screenshots/31_vis_courses_highest_cost.png)

Thread sequence:
1. Which professors have above-average evaluation scores and below-average cost per course?
2. Is there a correlation between Class Size (CourseEnrollmentCount) and EvaluationScore?
3. Do Student Type (Youth vs Adult Continuing Education) affect EvaluationScore?
4. Which low-cost courses have low evaluation scores and could benefit from interventions?
5. Recommendation: pilot program to test inexpensive instructional improvements.
